// removes unused code (technically, the linker, using -fdata-sections
// and -ffunction-sections when compiling, and Wl,--gc-sections
// when linking), so most of these will not result in any code size
// reduction.  Well, unless you try to use the missing features
// and redesign your program to not need them!  ONEWIRE_CRC8_TABLE
// is the exception, because it selects a fast but large algorithm
// or a small but slow algorithm.
